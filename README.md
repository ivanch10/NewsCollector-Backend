# News Collector Website Backend
## Background and Introduction
Living in this fast-paced era, people from all walks of lives all have
the demand of reading news every day. Since modern people’s
time is so limited, we decide to build a news aggregation website
catering to their needs. This innovative News Collector is a news
aggregator website that collects the latest news from different
news providers. It aggregates contents from the major English news
website, like Time, ABC News, Fox News, etc, and presents the
newsfeeds in a unified format for users to view. People can have a
convenient way to explore what’s happening in the world from
political issues to technology trends, to travel inspirations and so on.
News Collector is designed to save people’s time on finding news
by themselves and the extra work of switching between different
news media.

## Special Features
News Collector enables users to personalize news feeds by their
preferences. Users can change the weights of news sources (like
Time, ABC News, Fox News, etc), or by different news topics (like
sports, music, technology, etc). Moreover, we deploy different parts on
distinct servers, so that even if one point fails, the website can still be
stable and function as usual. This also makes future maintenance and
troubleshooting more easily.
